# React-kanban
It is a project of a website where you can organize your work by using kanban method <br>
I've used React.js for frontend and express.js for backend

# 
# What you can do?
1. Create new user
2. Add columns with custom names
3. Create tasks within those columns
4. Leave your app and have all changes saved automatically
# 
What I think that is worth to note, is that it's first app I've created by using React.js, so I'm not happy about every solution used but I think it was a solid beginning
